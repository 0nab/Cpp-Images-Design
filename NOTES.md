### For handling bytes, we might want to use

std:uint8_t

### What is a wedge?

It's the same as a gradient.
The starting point should have the value of 0,
and the end point should have the value of 255.
In this case, the max value happens to be 255 because
all data happen to be stored as 8 bits. 2^8 = 256
