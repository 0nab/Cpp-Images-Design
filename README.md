# A C++ class for images

Created as a part of
our *C++ Programming* course assignment.

<br>

***Core Design***
- [ ] All bits are stored as a single-dinension array.
- [ ] Internally, we keep track of the image structure using
three variables: `nl` number of lines, `ns` number of samples,
and `nb` number of bands.
- [ ] Support for 8-bit images with unsigned integers, but at the same time,
all of our valuables should be future proof for 16-bit and 32-bit as well.
- [ ] Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit.

<br>

***Constructors Design***
- [ ] Constrictor for `.png` files.
- [ ] Constructor by a constant value for testing purposes.
- [ ] Constructor for a wedge of pixel values for testing purposes.
- [ ] Copy / move operator overloads.
- [ ] Destructors to prevent memory leaks.

<br>

***Helper Functions Design***
- [ ] ...

<br>

To do:
- Now, we gotta add specific design plans,
such as what data types we're gonna use --
vectors of unsigned integer?
- What kind of files we'll have in our project
-- e.g. `main.cpp`, `images.h`, and `images.cpp`
